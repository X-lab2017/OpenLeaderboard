    "activity": "Activity is an algorithm based on the analysis method of historical behavior log data, which counts the behavior of all warehouses and developers of GitHub in the whole domain, and weights the behavior data of GitHub. The specific calculation method is: ad = ∑ wiciad = ∑ wici, where ADAD is the developer activity, and CICI is the occurrence times of the above five behavior events triggered by the developer, Wiwi is the weighted proportion of the behavior event. According to a simple value evaluation, we can set this value to 1 - 5, that is, 1 point for issue comment, 2 points for issue, 3 points for PR, 4 points for code review comment on PR, and 5 points for pr. After the activity of each developer is calculated, the activity of the project can be calculated by a weighted sum method. The previously given method is: ar = ∑ ad − − √ ar = ∑ ad, that is, the activity of the project is the sum of the activity of all developers. Here, the square is to reduce the impact of the excessive activity of core developers. (project activity only considers the behavior data of developers in the current project.) for more information about activity, please check ",
    "influence": "On the basis of activity, a new upper layer algorithm is designed, which is a project influence evaluation method based on the global developer cooperation network. While evaluating the cooperation influence of all projects at one time, it can also deeply explore the cooperation relevance of the project and automatically judge the category of the project, So as to obtain the network cooperation influence of projects and individuals.
